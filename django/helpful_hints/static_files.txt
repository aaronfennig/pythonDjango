Static Files
Objectives:
Organize static files properly within a Django project
Learn the syntax for referencing static content in templates
The organization and behavior of static files is very similar to templates. Within each app, at the same level as our templates folder, we also need a folder called static. Then within that folder, we can save all of our static content (and further subdivide into js, css, and images folders as desired).

In our templates, when we want to reference our static files, we'll first need to add a line indicating we want to use our static files:

<!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8">
      <title>Index</title>
      {% load static %}		<!-- added this line -->

Then we can reference any static files relative to their location within the folder called static:

<!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8">
      <title>Index</title>
      {% load static %}
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'css/style.css' %}">    
      <script src="{% static 'js/script.js' %}"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
    	<img src="{% static 'images/image.jpg' %}" />
    </body>
